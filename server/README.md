# ⚙️ Game Server
Docker files and configurations for setting up and managing our Nakama server infrastructure.

## Extensions
We wrote a couple extensions in Go to enhance the functionality of the Nakama game server. They must be compiled into a shared object (.so) library and loaded onto the ealpizar.com server's Nakama instance.
